# About Me

I'm a seasoned frontend professional with extensive practical experience in React, CSS, and JavaScript. I excel at leveraging modern frontend technologies, including async/await, to build high-performance, responsive, and user-friendly applications.

I also have a deep understanding of Node.js package management, with a strong preference for pnpm to ensure efficient and optimized project dependencies. Furthermore, I'm proficient in configuring and applying various linters, specifically ESLint and Oxlint, to maintain code quality, consistency, and readability.

Beyond my frontend expertise, I'm a blockchain specialist. I possess a deep understanding of blockchain fundamentals, consensus mechanisms, and smart contracts. I frequently interact directly with smart contracts on the blockchain, extracting critical data and presenting this information clearly on web interfaces.

# How I Use the Gemini CLI Tool

The Gemini CLI Tool will be an indispensable asset in my daily workflow, especially when tackling the following tasks:

## 1. Blockchain Contract Interaction

- **Contract Read Operations:** Quickly query public variables or call read-only functions of smart contracts to fetch on-chain data (e.g., token balances, NFT metadata, governance proposal statuses).
- **Transaction Signing & Sending:** Assist in constructing, signing, and sending transactions that interact with smart contracts (e.g., transferring tokens, calling write functions, staking).
- **Event Listening:** Set up listeners for specific contract events to update web data in real-time when on-chain states change.
- **Gas Estimation:** Estimate the gas fees required for transactions to better manage costs and user experience.

## 2. Frontend Development Assistance

- **Data Formatting & Parsing:** Convert raw data fetched from the blockchain (e.g., big numbers, hexadecimal strings) into formats readable and presentable by the frontend.
- **State Management Advice:** Provide best practices for efficient state management in React applications, specifically for blockchain-derived data.
- **CSS Style Generation:** Quickly generate or adjust CSS styles to enhance the presentation of blockchain data according to design requirements.
- **Asynchronous Logic Helper:** Offer code snippets or conceptual guidance for handling complex error management or concurrent requests within async/await patterns.

## 3. Package Management & Code Quality

- **pnpm Project Management:** Provide assistance and advice on pnpm workspaces setup, dependency optimization, or specific pnpm commands.
- **Linter Config Generation:** Help generate or adjust configuration files for ESLint or Oxlint, including rule sets tailored for React, TypeScript, or specific frameworks.
- **Code Quality Analysis:** Based on project code, provide interpretations of linter reports or suggest areas for improvement.
- **Automation Workflow Integration:** Assist in integrating linters and package management into CI/CD pipelines or Git Hooks.

## 4. Data Visualization

- **Chart Generation:** Suggest or provide code to generate suitable charts for web presentation (e.g., using Chart.js or D3.js) based on time-series or statistical data obtained from the blockchain.
- **Data Table Rendering:** Help structure complex blockchain data and render it in clear tabular formats on the webpage.

# Types of Assistance Expected from Gemini

I expect Gemini to understand my multifaceted role as a frontend, Node.js package management, and blockchain expert, and provide the following types of assistance:

- **Code Generation:** Directly generate usable code snippets for common contract interaction patterns, data processing, UI rendering, or linter configurations (e.g., Ethers.js or Web3.js calls, React components, ESLint configs).
- **Problem Diagnosis:** When I encounter errors interacting with the blockchain, unusual frontend data display, or puzzling linter reports, help diagnose the root cause of the problem.
- **Best Practices:** Offer recommendations on blockchain security, frontend performance optimization, async/await error handling, pnpm best practices, and linter rule configurations.
- **New Technology Exploration:** When new blockchain protocols, EVM-compatible chains, frontend frameworks, or package management tools emerge, provide relevant information and integration advice.
